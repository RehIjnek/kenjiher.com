                    Hello! I'm Kenji Her, a data engineer at Travelers Insurance. 
                    Originally from Saint Paul, Minnesota, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics 
                    and Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota.
                    Outside of work and academics, I enjoy browsing reddit, hitting the gym, and playing ultimate frisbee.
                    I also hope to use this personal website as a medium to express more creativity in my life.

                    Have I mentioned that I play ultimate frisbee? 
                    One summer day before my freshman year of high school, 
                    I was tossing with some of my cousins who played. 
                    They gave me a hard time about my terrible throws. 
                    Fast forward to the club fair that same year—
                    I signed up for my high school’s club team to prove to them—
                    and myself—that I could improve. Since joining, 
                    Ultimate has been a crucial part of my life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although my high school's team wasn’t among the top-ranked in Minnesota, 
                    we steadily improved over my four years there. Along the way, 
                    I earned several accolades: twice named captain, two-time all-conference, 
                    all-state selection, and a 4th-place finish at YCC. 
                    I also helped make ultimate frisbee a varsity letter sport at Roseville.
                    By senior year, I knew ultimate would play a major role in my college decision.
                    Ultimately, I chose to attend the University of Minnesota
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike my high school, the U had an established program that competed nationally. 
                    After being cut from the final round of Grey Duck tryouts, I officially joined the 
                    U’s B team, Ugly Duckling. While I was disappointed with the outcome, freshman 
                    year tryouts taught me valuable lessons—the biggest being that I had to unlearn 
                    bad habits. That year, Ugly made it to regionals for the second time in team 
                    history—as far as I know. In my sophomore year, I chose to self-cut from 
                    the final round of Grey Duck tryouts. It was a tough decision since I always 
                    thought I wanted to compete at the highest level. But my first year on 
                    Ugly showed me that playing with my friends was more important—and we 
                    were supposed to be cracked that year. Unfortunately, the pandemic 
                    brought my college frisbee experience to a halt. Frisbee didn’t resume 
                    until the fall of my senior year. By then, I had also been named captain 
                    of Ugly. The pandemic gave me time to reflect on my future in ultimate, 
                    and I struggled with the thought of whether I’d regret not giving my all in 
                    college ultimate. After some encouragement from my friends, I took a leap 
                    and went for one last real tryout. To my surprise, Grey Duck took me 
                    as a senior—something almost unheard of at the time. Long story short, 
                    I ended up playing two more years for Grey Duck in graduate school and 
                    earned unc status. During my time on the team, we placed 5th, 13th, and 5th, 
                    respectively. Looking back, I’m incredibly grateful I didn’t give up on myself. 
                    Ultimate—and Grey Duck—shaped who I am today. 1D1L.

                    I’m not sure if there’s much left to my competitive ultimate career, 
                    but playing club will be a game-time decision.
