                    Hello! I'm Kenji Her, a data engineer at Travelers Insurance. 
                    Originally from Saint Paul, Minnesota, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics 
                    and Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota.
                    Outside of work and academics, I enjoy raving, hitting the gym, and playing ultimate frisbee.
                    I also hope to use this personal website as a medium to express more creativity in my life.

                    Have I mentioned that I play ultimate frisbee? 
                    One summer day before my freshman year of high school, 
                    I was tossing with some of my cousins who played. 
                    They gave me a hard time about my terrible throws. 
                    Fast forward to the club fair that same year—
                    I signed up for my high school’s club team to prove to them—
                    and myself—that I could improve. Since joining, 
                    Ultimate has been a crucial part of my life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although my high school's team wasn’t among the top-ranked in Minnesota, 
                    we steadily improved over my four years there. Along the way, 
                    I earned several accolades: twice named captain, two-time all-conference, 
                    all-state selection, and a 4th-place finish at YCC. 
                    I also helped make ultimate frisbee a varsity letter sport at Roseville.
                    By senior year, I knew ultimate would play a major role in my college decision.
                    Ultimately, I chose to attend the University of Minnesota
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike my high school, the U of M had an established national contending program.
                    After eventually being cut from the last round of closed tryouts, I officially
                    joined the U's B team, Ugly Duckling. My freshman year tryouts taught me many
                    valuable lessons, a significant one being that I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits.
